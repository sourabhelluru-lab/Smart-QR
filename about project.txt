Smart QR Code for Tablet Batches:
In the current pharmaceutical system, only one QR code is usually printed on a full strip of tablets. When a customer purchases just one or two tablets instead of the entire strip, they often lose access to important information such as:
1.The tablet name
2.Manufacturer
3.Purpose of the medicine
4.Expiry date
5.Authenticity

To solve this, Smart QR proposes a system where every individual tablet in a strip carries a QR code.
However, instead of generating millions of unique QR codes for each tablet, this project introduces an efficient solution:

⭐ One QR code per batch, per day.
All tablets produced in the same batch on the same day share one QR code, since:
1.The expiry date remains the same.
2.Manufacturing details are the same.
3.Product information is identical.

This dramatically reduces complexity while ensuring every tablet has a scannable identity.
